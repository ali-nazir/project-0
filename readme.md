The first page is home.html which contains information about the website.
I use html list to vreat a navigation bar and added other 3 html files on it
Using padding and margins I adjusted the location of links
On home page there is one Image 

The second link is sercive.html in which bootstrap is used. 
for responsive website I used column wise classes of bootstrap learned from w3schools.com
In the same page I added 4 responsive columns and each column includes a picture.

Third link is about.html which only includes a heading and a paragraph

Fourth link is contact.html which includes a table.

All the pages have an ending line.
